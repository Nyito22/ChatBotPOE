This Project is about a cyber security ChatBot 

This this Artificial intelligence is based on cyber security, so I created 4 external classes, the first class is the Voice class, logo class, StoreArray response class, the prompt user class.
The logo class converts the image into ascii using Bitmap, and they it displays the logo, the voce class, plays the voice and then uses exception handling to check if the audio is available.
The store class stores the arraylist that have responses and words to ignore.

Functionality
So included the color to make the Bot to be user friendly, the logo has it own color and the Bot starts first by playing the audio then it displays the logo.
It also has welcoming messages, these messages enhance uer experience and they have their own colors.
I also added input validation to validate/check use input, do if the user input is null the bot automatically displays and invalid messag that is displayed in red
